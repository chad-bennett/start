Iâ€™m just a guy who likes making stuff, mostly visual stuff. I make art, fiddle on the computer, and try to live the best life I can. Teaching art and design has become my passion, I love helping students find their own artistic voices. I live in the country with my wonderful wife, two crazy kids, three kitties, a bunny, and a groundhog that lives under the shed. I enjoy eating tacos and ice-cream, but not at the same time.

This site is a simple place to share resources with my students. Eventually I will probably fill it out with art and personal content.
