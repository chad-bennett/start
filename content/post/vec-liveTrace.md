**introduction to using Image Trace in Adobe Illustrator to automatically convert raster to vector**

<!--more-->

Image Trace in Adobe Illustrator is an awesome tool that lets you convert raster graphics (pixels) to vectors (paths). There are a number of settings and options to explore that may be confusing when you first start using it. Here are a few resources to help you get started:

- [Image Trace from Adobe Help](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/image-trace.html) - basic introduction to the tools
- [How to edit drawings in Illustrator with Image Trace from CreativeBloq](https://www.creativebloq.com/illustrator/edit-drawings-image-trace-5132576) - wonderful walk-through of the workflow
- [Automatically Tracing Images in Adobe Illustrator from ThinkB!G.LearnSmart](https://youtu.be/_8qLwnECT9E) - youtube video showing the process

If you don't have Adobe Illustrator, you aren't completely out of luck, although the options are quite limited.  

- [Vector Magic](https://vectormagic.com/) is a great online alternative, although it will set you back about $10 a month to use 
- [Autotracer](https://www.autotracer.org/) is free to use online tool, but a bit clunky. Your best bet is to export to .eps or .svg file format
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) can convert raster to vector, but outputs only black and white, which is good for converting line drawings, but not much else
