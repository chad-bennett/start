**working with built-in geometric shapes in Adobe Illustrator**

<!--more-->


Illustrator has a number of basic shape tools in the main toolbox that you can use to make things like rectangles and ellipsis. Those default basic shapes are only a starting point. It is possible to interactively manipulate those shapes to make more complex designs. Here are some resources to help you see how to get started. 



- [Live shapes from Adobe Help](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/live-shapes.html) - nice breakdown of the different shape tools and how they can be used to create more complex shapes using interactive tools. 

- [Draw, edit, and re-edit shapes easily from Adobe Help](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/live-shapes.html) - how to draw and manipulate the basic geometric shapes.
