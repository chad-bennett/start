**get started learning Adobe Illustrator**

<!--more-->

Adobe Illustrator is one of the leading vector drawing programs, so there are tons of resources out there to help learn the tools. Yes, you are in a class that is focused on teaching you Illustrator, however there are other resources that can supplement what we are doing in class. 

- [Illustrator tutorials provided by Adobe](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html) - nice video tutorials from beginner to advanced. They also have a few decent learning projects that include project files. 

- [Learn Adobe Illustrator by Tasty Tuts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfCBK8IplO4X-jM1Rp43wAIdpP2XNGwP) - a quick introductory course on youtube with 20 epsiodes. 

- [Illustrator Training Tutorials on Lynda/LinkedIn Learning](https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-training-tutorials/227-0.html) - plenty of videos and trainings here.
