**converting Adobe Illustrator vectors to pixel-based rasters**



<!--more-->



Vectors are a powerful way to create graphics, however the file formats available don't play well with internet browsers. You will need to flatten your vector work into a jpg or png to be able to post it to the internet. There are several methods that we will get into over the course. This is the simplest process:



1. Open your vector file in Illustrator

2. From the pull-down menus select **File > Export > Export As...**

3. Be sure to save as either a jpg or png

4. Choose your save location (easiest to choose Desktop)

5. Press **Export**

6. Enjoy!
