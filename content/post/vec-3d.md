**a few ways to build pseudo three-dimensional content in Adobe Illustrator**

<!--more-->

Three-dimensional effects are quite popular in illustration these days. While Illustrator does not have a dedicated 3D mode, there are some tools and techniques you can use to create the illusion of depth. 



## PERSPECTIVE GRID



Perspective can be a difficult and time consuming process to draw. Illustrator has a set of tools that will help you get started quickly. It looks extremely scary at first, but is actually quite easy to set up. These resources will help:

## ISOMETRIC DRAWING



Isometric drawing is quite popular these days. Illustrator doesn't have specific grid tools to build isometric layouts, however the grids are not too difficult to create on your own. Illustrator does have tools to extrude flat shapes into 3d primitives. That makes it quite easy to start building something. These resources will help:
