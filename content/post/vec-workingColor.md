**introduction to color in Adobe Illustrator**



<!--more-->



Adobe Illustrator handles color differently than what you are probably used to in Photoshop. Illustrator is often used to create documents meant for printing and so there are many different technical options to be aware of. As an artistic tool,there are also many options for creating color schemes and palettes. The color options are far more complex and interesting, but also hidden away in different interface locations, so it is easy to miss some important tools. Here are some resources to help understand how to work with color.
