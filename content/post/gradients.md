**a collection of places to find web gradients for use on your websites**

<!--more-->

[colorful gradients have become quite a popular trend](https://designmodo.com/gradients/). [here are some great website examples](https://designmodo.com/websites-gradients/). personally, i absolutely love this trend and hope that it continues for a long time. gradients are a simple and effective way to add splashes of color and personality to a website. plus, since they are usually only a few lines of css code, load times are usually much quicker than using images. 

[the w3schools site has a solid introduction on how to build gradients in css.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) 

since gradients have become such a trend, it makes sense that there would be plenty of tools and libraries out there to help designers with their work. here are a number of places that i've found for you to use...
