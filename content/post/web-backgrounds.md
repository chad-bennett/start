**a collection of places to create and download web background images, patterns, and textures**

<!--more-->

as a designer, iâ€™m always up for free resources to help me get a project done or to find that extra element to make the design sing. although it seems like web design trends have gone toward simple colors and gradients, i believe there is still a need for background images and textures. of course, you can make your own, but why not use one of these tools or resources instead? 

## images & textures to download

- [subtle patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/) - my absolute favorite place to find background textures and patterns that aren't too ostentatious. 
- [background image generator](http://bg.siteorigin.com/) - stack layered textures and colors
- [zen bg](https://galactic.ink/bg/) - mix translucent textures with css color to get both the image and css codes

## build your own image patterns

- [bg patterns](http://bgpatterns.com/) - build with icons and vector shapes
- [plain pattern](http://www.kennethcachia.com/plain-pattern/app/) - work in progress, but still cool. build seamless tile with svg vector shapes. limited number of shapes provided, but can upload your own shapes
- [patternify](http://www.patternify.com/) - pixel art patterns
- [transparent textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/) - mix translucent textures with css color to get both the image and css codes. more refined looking textures
- [pattern cooler](https://patterncooler.com/) - tiled images and colors. some very bold and intense patterns possible
- [trianglify](https://trianglify.io/) -generates low-poly background images
- [noise texture generator](http://www.noisetexturegenerator.com/) - simple, well-built generator that creates noise textures. can download as colored opaque or transparent
