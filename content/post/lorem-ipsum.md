**a collection of places to get fun [lorem ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/) text for use in your layouts because you don't always have written content when you want to play with visual layout.** 

<!--more-->

as a designer, i’m always up for free resources to help me get a project done or to find that extra element to make the design sing. usually i need filler text to style because the client hasn’t given me any actual content to work with. that’s when lorem ipsum filler text helps out. while there are some great basic generators, there are lots of options out there for fun filler text as well.   

## normal

- [boom online](https://www.boom-online.co.uk/lorem-ipsum/) - this really cool generator pulls content about your chosen topic from wikipedia for interesting and unique ipsum.  
- [website planet](https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/lorem-ipsum/) - nice, clean generator with a few options. quick and easy to use. 
- [get lorem](https://getlorem.com/) - simple and straight-forward generator that also has a nice history of lorem ipsum. good no-frills generator for default ipsum 
- [blind text generator](http://www.blindtextgenerator.com/lorem-ipsum) - has lots of different options beyond the traditional lorem ipsum. there’s also an html snippets section that gives you lorem ipsum already tagged as different html elements
