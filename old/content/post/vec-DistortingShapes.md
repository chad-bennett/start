**a few ways to modify and manipulate your shapes in Adobe Illustrator**

<!--more-->

Illustrator has many different tools to create shapes, including the Pen tools, the Brush tools, and the Live Shape tools. There are also many ways to modify the shapes you have already created. The Add, Subtract, and Modify anchor point tools that hang out in the same drawer as the Pen Tool are good for fine-grained control, but can be tedious to work with. Fortunately, there are other tools that allow more interesting modifications. 



## Warp Tools

These tools are similar to the Liquify Tools you may have used in Photoshop. The brush-based set includes things like Warp, Pucker, Bloat, Crystallize, Wrinkle. I encourage you to explore all the different options to see what they do. 



There is a drawer full of the tools in your Toolbox. If you know you will be using multiple tools, it is best to use the Tear-off feature to get a floating panel with all the tool icons visible. To adjust settings, double-click on the tool icon. Note that settings such as size and intensity carry over from tool to tool.

## Envelope Distort Warp

This tool is similar to the Warp Tool in Photoshop. Warp styles include things like Arc, Arch, Flag, Bulge, etc. Adjustment sliders allow you to tweak how the warp is applied. 



To use Envelope Distort, select your elements and go to **Object > Envelope Distort > Make With Warp...** From there you can tweak and adjust as needed. The settings will remain as part of the envelope object so you can go back and tweak whenever you want. To apply the warp completely, go to **Object > Envelope Distort > Expand**.

## Envelope Distort Mesh

If Envelope Distort Warp doesn't get you what you want, you can use the Envelope Distort Mesh Tool to add your own custom grid to your elements and then warp in your own way. 



To use Envelope Distort, select your elements and go to **Object > Envelope Distort > Make With Mesh...** There is also a tool for this option in the main toolbox. From there you can tweak and adjust as needed. The settings will remain as part of the envelope object so you can go back and tweak whenever you want. To apply the warp completely, go to **Object > Envelope Distort > Expand**. 



## Puppet Warp

This is another tool that comes over from Photoshop. It is my favorite way to move elements around because it is almost like sculpting your shapes. The result can make your shapes look more natural and organic. This is tool is hard to explain in words, so go watch a [video about Puppet Warp](https://youtu.be/bFBkFkjKsto) to understand. 



To use Puppet Warp, select your elements and pick the Puppet Warp icon in the toolbox. It usually hangs out in the same drawer as the Free Transform Tool. A mesh of cobwebs will appear over your elements. You can pick intersections on the mesh to add anchor points that act as locks and handles that can be used to move your elements around. Select one or more points, move them around, and marvel at the magic that is happening on your screen.
