This list is primarily for my Vector Illustration students who are completing an Editorial Illustration project using Adobe Illustrator. My picks are mostly geared toward vector art, although there are plenty of great illustrators using raster and traditional art techniques. 

As always, if you have a recommendation for someone to add to this list, please send me a link. Thanks!
