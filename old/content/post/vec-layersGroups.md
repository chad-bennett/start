**using layers and groups to organize content in Adobe Illustrator**

<!--more-->

Compared to Photoshop, Layers behave quite differently in Illustrator. I like the analogy of a file cabinet for understanding layers.  The entire digital file is one big filing cabinet. Every element exists as its own line in the Layers Palette, much like being on its own sheet of paper. The main layers are like drawers in the cabinet. Sub-layers are like folders that can contain multiple sheets of paper or even more folders with sheets of paper inside them. Thankfully it is much easier to move your elements into other folders or even other drawers than it would be with traditional sheets of paper.

Staying organized with layers will be critical, especially once you start creating files with thousands of elements. The following resources will help you to understand the different ways to wrangle your elements into some sense of organization.

Groups allow you to combine multiple elements into one object that can be moved around and modified as one unit. Many groups can be put into one layer.
