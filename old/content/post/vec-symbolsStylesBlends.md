**introduction to creating and using Symbols in Adobe Illustrator**



<!--more-->



Symbols are a way to save and store elements so they can be reused. You can alter the main symbol element and it updates across all instances or you can make variations on individual instances. Even better, there are Symbol Spray tools that allow you to alter and randomize entire groups of symbols. These are a powerful feature of Illustrator.

I would like for you to create your own symbols for this project because it is good to make your own art. When you are stuck for time, however, you will find there are tons of premade symbols you can download from the internet. 



## GRAPHIC STYLES



Graphic Styles are a way to save special effects that have been applied to an element so that the same effects can be added to multiple elements. This is especially powerful when you want visual consistency across many elements or sets.

## BLENDS



Blends are a good way to create a progressive rhythm that transitions from one state to another. They are also a quick and easy way to find variations on a spectrum between two extremes.
